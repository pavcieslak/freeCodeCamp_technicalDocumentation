        <p>The BMW M40 is an SOHC four-cylinder petrol engine which was produced from 1987–1994.[1][2] It served as BMW's base model four-cylinder engine and was produced alongside the higher performance BMW M42 DOHC four-cylinder engine from 1989 onwards.</p>
        <p>Compared with its M10 predecessor, the M40 uses a belt-driven camshaft,[3] and hydraulic tappets. Like the M10, the M40 uses an iron block and an aluminium head. Fuel injection for the E30 versions is Bosch Motronic 1.3,[4] and the E36 versions use Bosch Motronic 1.7.[5][6]<br /><br />
        Following the introduction of the BMW M43 engine in 1991, the M40 began to be phased out.</p>

        <h2>Engine reliability</h2>
      </header>
        <p>M40B18 also belongs to BMW M40 series and it is an elder brother of M40B16 engine. It was developed in 1987 as replacement of older M10 series that was already out-of-date at that time. This motor is based on cast-iron cylinder block, 8-valve cylinder head with one camshaft and hydraulic lifters. Valve adjustment is not necessary for M40B18. Diameter of inlet valves is 42 mm while outlet valves are 36 mm in diameter. BMW M40 camshaft specs are as follows: duration 244/244 deg, lift 10.6/10.6 mm.</p>
        <p>Engine is equipped with unreliable timing belt which calls for regular checking and control. Replacement of the belt is necessary every 25,000 miles (40,000 km) of mileage. Drivers should take this problem rather seriously otherwise belt break down can lead to bended valves.
          This engine was mainly used for BMW 18i models.</p>
        <code>console.log('Diameter of inlet valves is 42 mm while outlet valves are 36 mm in diameter. BMW M40 camshaft specs are as follows: duration 244/244 deg, lift 10.6/10.6 mm.');</code>

        <h2>Disadvantages and problems</h2>
      </header>
        <p>1. Engine knocking. As a rule M40 engines are rather noisy. This is due camshaft and hydraulic tappets wear out. That is why it is necessary to check conditions of camshaft regularly. In case you see any notice of wearing off, this detail must be replaced as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>2. Rough idle. Air flow sensor must also be checked. It may be damaged after some time which can result in air leaking.
          Next you need to have your air flow sensor and oxygen sensor checked. Also pay attention to conditions of the throttle body and idling valve. Another problem of uneven idling can be connected with difficult rotating of camshaft.</p>
        <p>3. Acceleration problems. The main reason for such problem is related to polluted injectors. If you clean them, the problem will be gone.</p>
        <p>4. Overheating. First of all you need to examine your radiator in case such problem occurs. Don’t forget to check water pump and thermostat. Also pay attention to conditions of plastic pipes which are part of the cooling system.</p>
        <p>5. M40 is unable to start. You can find the reason of this problem in fuel pump, spark plugs, high-voltage wires and ignition coil. BMW M40 engine has already proved to be rather unreliable. Its lifespan is about 180,000 miles (300,000 km) of mileage. In some occasions it can be a little higher. Nevertheless the majority of BMW M40B18 engines have already used their lifespan and nothing can be said about their reliability and usage.<br /><br />
        Is BMW M40B18 really worth buying? No, it isn’t. You’d better purchase BMW M50 or M54. These engines are much better and have higher level of reliability.</p>

        <h2>Engine tuning</h2>
      </header>
        <p>M40B18 engine is equal to M40B16 when it comes to tuning and different mods.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that M40 engine tuning is not the best solution for investment. It would be better to buy more reliable and powerful engines such as BMW M50B25 or M54B30, proceed with swap and enjoy fast ride.
          If you still want to develop your small M40 motor than you should forget about chip-tuning as it will be absolutely useless in this occasion. Stroker is the best variant for this engine.
          The first step is to remake your M40B16 to M40B18. You will need stroker kit for this mode taken from M40B18. The kit includes crankshaft, pistons, throttle body, intake manifold and ECU.</p>

        <p>Before you start spending thousands of dollars for turbo tuning of M40 you need to have clear understanding that it would be better to and less expensive to purchase BMW M50B25 or M54B30. These engines have higher level of reliability and margin of safety to proceed with modifications.</p>
        <p>BMW M40 can cope with turbocharging rather well. Stock internals are enough to deal with over 19 psi (1.3 bar) boost due to thick cylinder head gasket and <a href="https://arp-bolts.com/kits/arpkit-detail.php?RecordID=1230" alt="ARP Studs" target="_blank">ARP studs</a>. If you want to increase engine power you need to buy TD04 turbocharger or any other equal to it, weld turbo manifold, purchase intercooler, blow-off, wastegate, install oil feed line and oil return line. Moreover you will additionally need fuel pressure regulator, Walbro 255 lph fuel pump, boost controller, 550 or 630 cc injectors, 2.5-inch piping and 2.5-inch exhaust system.</p>
